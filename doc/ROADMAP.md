# Learn Algorithms Roadmap

## Step 1: Strengthen the Fundamentals  
Before diving into complex algorithms, ensure you have a solid grasp of data structures since they are the building blocks of algorithms.  

### ðŸ“Œ Topics to Cover:
- **Arrays & Strings**  
- **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- **Stacks & Queues**  
- **Hash Tables / HashMaps**  
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, BST, Trie)  
- **Graphs** (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)  
- **Heaps & Priority Queues**  
- **Dynamic Arrays & Bit Manipulation**  

### ðŸ›  Resources:
- *Algorithms, 4th Edition* by Robert Sedgewick  
- **LeetCode:** Easy problems in Array, HashMap, Linked List

## Step 2: Learn Basic Algorithmic Techniques  
Once you're comfortable with data structures, learn problem-solving techniques.  

### ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts:
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Counting, Radix  
- **Searching Algorithms:** Binary Search, BFS, DFS  
- **Two Pointers Technique**  
- **Sliding Window**  
- **Greedy Algorithms**  
- **Recursion & Backtracking**  
- **Divide and Conquer**  

### ðŸ›  Resources:
- *Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms* by Anany Levitin  
- **LeetCode:** Medium-level sorting/search problems  
- **Practice:** Implement sorting algorithms from scratch in Kotlin

## Step 3: Master Advanced Algorithms  
After mastering the basics, move to more complex topics.  

### ðŸ“Œ Topics to Master:
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Top-down, Bottom-up, Memoization, Tabulation  
- **Graph Algorithms:** Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A*  
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Kruskal, Prim  
- **Network Flow:** Ford-Fulkerson  
- **String Algorithms:** KMP, Rabin-Karp, Suffix Arrays  
- **Number Theory:** GCD, LCM, Primes, Modular Arithmetic  
- **Bit Manipulation**  

### ðŸ›  Resources:
- *The Algorithm Design Manual* by Steven Skiena  
- **Practice:** LeetCode / Codeforces / AtCoder  

---

## Step 4: Practice, Practice, Practice!  

### ðŸ“Œ Daily Goals:
âœ… Solve **1-2 easy problems per day** â†’ LeetCode Easy  
âœ… Gradually move to **1 medium per day** â†’ LeetCode Medium  
âœ… Challenge yourself with **1 hard problem per week**  

### ðŸ“Œ Where to Practice:
- **LeetCode** â†’ Best for interviews and structured learning  
- **Codeforces** â†’ Great for competitive programming  
- **AtCoder** â†’ Ideal for mathematical problems  
- **Advent of Code** â†’ Fun yearly challenge
