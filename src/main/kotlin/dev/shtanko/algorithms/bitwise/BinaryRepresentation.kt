/**
 * Converts a 32-bit unsigned integer to its binary representation.
 *
 * The method takes a 32-bit unsigned integer and returns its binary representation as a string.
 * It starts from the most significant bit (bit 31) and iterates through each bit, appending "1" if the bit is ON (1),
 * or "0" if the bit is OFF (0). The resulting binary representation is returned as a string.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1)
 * Auxiliary Space: O(1)
