/**
 * Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.
 * It divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region
 * by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region. The algorithm
 * efficiently builds a max heap on the input array to facilitate the extraction of maximum elements.
 *
 * Worst-case performance:       O(n log n)
 * Best-case performance:        O(n log n)
 * Average performance:          O(n log n)
 * Worst-case space complexity:  O(1)
