/**
 * Pancake sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts a sequence by repeatedly flipping the elements.
 * In each iteration, it finds the maximum element and flips the subsequence from the first element
 * up to the maximum element.
 * This process is repeated until the sequence is sorted.
 *
 * Worst-case performance:       O(n^2)
 * Best-case performance:        O(n)
 * Average performance:          O(n^2)
 * Worst-case space complexity:  O(1)
