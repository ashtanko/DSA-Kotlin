/**
 * Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the array into a sorted
 * and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region
 * and moves it to the sorted region. The algorithm maintains two subarrays: the subarray of sorted elements
 * and the subarray of unsorted elements.
 *
 * Worst-case performance:       O(n^2)
 * Best-case performance:        O(n^2)
 * Average performance:          O(n^2)
 * Worst-case space complexity:  O(1)
