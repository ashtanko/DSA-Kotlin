/**
 * Shell sort is an in-place comparison sort that can be seen as either a generalization of insertion sort or a
 * variation of bubble sort. It starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other and progressively
 * reducing the gap between elements to be compared. The final iteration uses a gap of 1, which is equivalent to
 * an insertion sort. The algorithm's time complexity depends on the chosen gap sequence.
 *
 * Worst-case performance:       O(n^2)
 * Best-case performance:        O(n log n)
 * Average performance:          Depends on the gap sequence
 * Worst-case space complexity:  O(1)
 * Stable: No
