/**
 * Computes the factorial of the given input using tail recursion.
 * Factorial, in mathematics, the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer

 * meaning 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7. Factorial zero is defined as equal to 1.
 *
 * @param input The input number to compute the factorial of.
 * @param temp The temporary variable to store the intermediate result (default: 1).
 * @return The factorial of the input number.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the input is a negative number.
