/**
 * Calculates the binomial coefficient (n choose k).
 * A binomial coefficient C(n, k) can be defined as the coefficient of X^k in the expansion of (1 + X)^n.
 * A binomial coefficient C(n, k) also gives the number of ways, disregarding order,
 * that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of k-element subsets
 * (or k-combinations) of an n-element set.
 *
 * @param n The total number of items.
 * @param k The number of items to choose.
 * @return The binomial coefficient.
