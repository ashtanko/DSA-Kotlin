 * # Approach 1: Brute Force
 *
 * # Intuition
 * The problem is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific
 * target. A straightforward way to solve this is by checking every pair of
 * numbers to see if they sum to the target.
 *
 * # Approach
 * The brute force approach involves iterating over each element and checking it
 * against every other element to find a pair that sums to the target:
 *
 * 1. Use a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over each element `i` in
 * the array.
 * 2. The inner loop starts from `i + 1` and iterates over the remaining
 * elements `j` to check if the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` equals the target
 * 3. If such a pair is found, return their indices as an array.
 * 4. If no such pair is found after all iterations, return an empty array.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity: O(n^2)
 * The time complexity is quadratic because for each element, we check every
 * other element in the array.
 *
 * - Space complexity: O(1)
 * The space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of
 * additional space for variables.

/**
 * # Approach 2: Two-pass Hash Table
 *
 * # Intuition
 * The problem requires finding two numbers in an array that sum up to a given
 * target. Using a hash table allows us to efficiently track and check for the
 * required complement of each number in the array.
 *
 * # Approach
 * The approach involves two passes:
 * 1. First, we iterate through the array and store each number and its index in
 * a hash table.
 * 2. In the second pass, we iterate through the array again and for each
 * number, calculate its complement (target - number). We then check if this
 * complement exists in the hash table and ensure that it is not the same index
 * as the current number. If found, we return the indices of the current number
 * and its complement.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity: O(n)
 *   - The algorithm iterates through the array twice, each pass taking O(n)
 *   time.
 *
 * - Space complexity: O(n)
 *   - The hash table stores each of the n elements in the array.

 * # Approach 3: One-pass Hash Table
 *
 * # Intuition
 * The problem requires finding two numbers in an array that sum up to a given
 * target. Using a hash table allows us to efficiently track the numbers we have
 * seen so far and quickly check for the required complement of the current
 * number.
 *
 * # Approach
 * The approach involves a single pass through the array:
 * 1. Iterate through the array, for each number, calculate its complement
 * (target - number).
 * 2. Check if this complement exists in the hash table.
 *    - If it does, we have found the two numbers whose indices are to be
 *    returned.
 *    - If it does not, add the current number and its index to the hash table.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity: O(n)
 *   - The algorithm iterates through the array once, taking O(n) time.
 *
 * - Space complexity: O(n)
 *   - The hash table stores each of the n elements in the array.

 *
 * # Intuition
 * The problem requires finding two numbers in an array that sum up to a given

 *
 * # Approach
 * The approach involves a single pass through the array:
 * 1. Iterate through the array with both index and value using `forEachIndexed`
 * 2. For each number, check if it exists in the hash table.
 *    - If it does, it means we have already encountered the complement of the
 *    current number, and we can return the indices of these two numbers.
 *    - If it does not, add the difference between the target and the current
 *    number as the key, and the current index as the value in the hash table.
