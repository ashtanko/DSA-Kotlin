/**
 * # Intuition
 * The problem is to calculate the sum of the appeal of all substrings of a
 * given string. The appeal of a string is defined as the number of distinct
 * characters in it. The challenge is to efficiently compute this for all
 * substrings.
 *
 * # Approach
 * We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The key idea is to keep
 * track of the last position where each character appeared. For each character
 * in the string, we can calculate the contribution to the total appeal based on
 * its position and the previous positions of the same character. We maintain an
 * array `prev` where `prev[char - 'a']` keeps the last index of character
 * `char`. For each character at index `i`, the contribution to the appeal
 * is calculated as `i + 1 - prev[char - 'a']`. We then update the `prev` array
 * with the current index.
 *
 * # Complexity
 * - Time complexity: O(n)
 * The time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the string, since
 * we process each character exactly once.
 *
 * - Space complexity: O(1)
 * The space complexity is constant, as we use a fixed-size array of length 26
 * to keep track of the last positions of each
 * character (assuming only lowercase English letters).
