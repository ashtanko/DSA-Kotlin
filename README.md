## Overview

The repository is a collection of open-source implementations of a variety of algorithms implemented in Kotlin and
licensed under MIT License.
The implementations and their associated documentations are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and
students.
Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using different algorithm strategies and
optimizations.

## Features

* The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages
  - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)).
* Well documented source code with detailed explanations provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.
* Source codes are compiled and tested
* Self-checks within programs ensure correct implementations with confidence.
* Modular implementations and OpenSource licensing enable the functions to be utilized conveniently in other
  applications.
* Makefile
* JUnit 5
* Code checks (detekt, ktlint, spotless)
* CI
